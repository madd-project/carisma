# Clean Media
I had to say it only one thing, I got a goal in my mind, To connect People and Technology in a way there will be peace, beauty and power between technology and people just like you and me.

I said to that thing that, It is all about to connect the people with the Social Media in a way that we humans can't think of, In a way there will be no Addictions on the Social media, No Bullying, A Safe Place where we can breathe in peace and breathe off freedom.

And I can promise you! that after today, You would never look the social media in the same way.

# Features


### No posts that support Addictions,
What if there be a place where that is no nudity, nakedness, abuse, etc. 
The App already is capable to sort things in a way to see, if the post that user is going to add is addictive, or have nudity, etc. It already Distinguish and kill the photo and in most cases can ban the user. Thus making it a safe place. 

### Limited Posts, 
The Goal is to give you your faviourite things in one place, where you see your faviourite things and let go the world.
At the moment You will be seeing what you needs to see, It about saving [your] time (The Most Valueable Currency) In a way how Youtube works.  
The average person scrolls through 300 feet of mobile content every day. That's equivalent to the size of the Statue of Liberty.

### Fan-Letters
In a Whole Month, Get One Letter to give to a creator who you love and who made an Impact in your life.

### Follow Limited People
As the Posts are real Limited, You can make yourself to see limited ones, we can't be able to take inspirations from 1000s of people, It is only some who can push us.

### You Follow For yourself
You Follow What you love, You subscribe what you want to see. Not for showing other that, *See I follow Ronaldo* There is a healthy competition among the community, on who can make more impact (I have big plans on this), well This is an Idea of Youtube.
